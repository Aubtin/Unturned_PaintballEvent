# Unturned_PaintballEvent

Paintball server plugin that orchestrates the event. 

How it works:
- Teleports players to set location.
- Stores their items. 
- Manages players during the event as they wait, play, respawn, etc.
- Returns players and provides awards once completed.

Development ended late 2016.
